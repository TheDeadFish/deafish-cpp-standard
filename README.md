The deadfish c++ standard
-------------------------

The c++ standard is broken.
This is a fork of the c++ standard that fixes a few of what I consider to be incorrect facets of the original c++ standard.
This will include both changes to the standard library and core language. Core language changes are implemented in my fork of gcc.

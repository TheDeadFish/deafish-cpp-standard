std::byte;

Description {
	this exists in the c++ standard as 
	enum class byte : unsigned char {}	
	This was a mistake, it serves no real purpose but fucks up
	existing code which uses, typedef unsigned char byte;
	This bullshit is replaced by the typedef in deadfish c++
}

Reference implenentation {

	typedef unsigned char byte;
	template <class IntegerType>
	constexpr IntegerType to_integer(byte __b) noexcept 
		{ return IntegerType(__b) }
}
